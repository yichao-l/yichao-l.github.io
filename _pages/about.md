I am a [MSc student in Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/msc-computer-science/) at University of Oxford and 
a visiting student at [Prof. Josh Tenenbaum's lab](https://cocosci.mit.edu/).

Previously, I obtained my [BSc in Artificial Intelligence](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/17-18/dpt/utaintl.htm) with Class Prize for Top Performance at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics).

I am interested in significantly advancing the development of humankind by pushing the frontier of scientific understanding and engineering. To this end, I research in AI.

Concretly, I am interested in the complementary goals of building more human-like machine 
learning systems and better understanding human learning, with the ultimate goal of
reaching [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). 
To this end, I synthesize and build from the success of generations
of AI research: **probabilistic inference** for managing uncertainty, **neural networks**
for pattern recognition, **symbolic languages** for abstract knowledge representation,
**causal reasoning** for explainability and control, and **hierarchical inference**
for learning to learn.

Outside main research, I like to seek for truth and bueaty, as they are found in nature, maths, and art.
